# BankingAutomationTestPython
Using Selenium webdriver, Python and the built-in unittest module I was able to create testing scripts that go through a dummy banking site and interacts actual site usage. As time passes i'll continue adding more tests. Thanks for looking!
This is an ongoing project that i have, so as time passes i will continue adding more test cases along with trying new coding structures and processes.

In order to run this file you'll need to make sure you have Chrome 88 installed and do the following:

1. Fork the repo
2. CD into it via Terminal
3. Type in 'python3 WebBrowserAutomation.py' and 'Enter'
4. You'll see the tests run in another browser and the Terminal will show how many have passed and failed

Enjoy!
