# BankingAutomationTestPython
Using Selenium webdriver, Python and the built-in unittest module I was able to create testing scripts that go through a dummy banking site and interacts actual site usage. As time passes i'll continue adding more tests. Thanks for looking!
This is an ongoing project that i have, so as time passes i will continue adding more test cases along with trying new coding structures and processes.
